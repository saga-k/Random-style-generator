      <h1>This is a demo of the random
        style generator</h1>
      <p>The inspiration for this project came from an idea i had for my portfolio website.
        I wanted to create about 10 different stylesheets and loop through them at the click of a button.
        However, i realized i wanted to spend more time coding than designing.
        So i decided to try to generate some random styles dynamically.
        Some might turn out good, some might turn out really ugly.
        If you find something you like, you can download the css.

          <h3>Setting some boundaries</h3>
          <p>Because i want you reading this to be able to read it.
            I had to set some boundaries around which combinatons are allowed.
            As a designer i have some i have some experience around what works and what doesnt when it comes to
            readability.</p>

        <section class="card" id="lightOrDark">
          <h3>Light or dark</h3>
          <p>To avoid getting dark text on a dark background or vice versa i wanted my program to first select a light
            mode
            or a dark mode. </p>
        </section>

        <section class="card" id="colorPallate">
          <h3>Creating a color pallate</h3>
          <p>For a color pallate i want 2 background colors of the same hue but with different lightness.
            I also want a more saturated color for details such as buttons, icons and other elements.
            By using HSL values when generating the pallate i can control the saturation and lightness while letting
            the
            hue
            be randomly generated</p>
        </section>


        <section class="card" id="fonts">
          <h3>Adding fonts</h3>
          <p>By using the google fonts API i can acces the entire
            google fonts library and fetch anyfonts from there.
            For readability i'll only allow p elements to be serif or sans serif fonts.
            For headlines, i'll allow any font.
